This project is a real-time emotion detection app that runs entirely in the browser using face-api.js and your webcam. The emotion_detector.html file provides a clean, modern interface that detects faces, identifies expressions such as happy, sad, angry, or surprised, and displays both bounding boxes and emoji-based emotion labels. Pretrained model weights should be placed in the models/weights directory, and the app can be run locally using a simple HTTP server or VS Code’s Live Server. An optional train_model.py script is included for users who want to train or fine-tune their own emotion recognition models. Everything runs locally, requires only camera permission, and makes no external uploads.
